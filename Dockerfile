# ── Build/release metadata + optional Sentry source-map upload ───────────────
# All optional — a plain `docker build` with none of these still succeeds.
#   GIT_SHA         generic build identifier. Baked into the runtime image (prod
#                   stage below) and used as the Sentry release, so uploaded
#                   source maps line up with runtime events.
#   SENTRY_ORG /    only used to upload source maps. `npm run build` self-skips
#   SENTRY_PROJECT  the upload unless ORG + PROJECT + the sentry_auth_token
#                   secret are all present (see scripts/upload-server-sourcemaps.mjs
#                   and vite.server.config.ts). None of this is Buildkite- or
#                   Sentry-specific to the Dockerfile — the CI that supplies the
#                   values lives outside it (.buildkite/pipeline.yml here).
